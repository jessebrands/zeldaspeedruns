# ZeldaSpeedRuns

This project contains the new web application server for ZSR.

Development
-----------

To run the server, it is recommended to you use Docker. From your favorite
terminal program, navigate to the root directory (the one that contains this)
README and then run:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

You can now find the application server running at 
[localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
and the PostgreSQL server at `localhost:8432`.
